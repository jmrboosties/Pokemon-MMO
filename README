It is a fan project designed with the hope of creating a free and enjoyable experience for fans of the games.

Pokedex provided graciously by Veekun. All credit goes to him. Check out his website @ http://veekun.com/ to support him, and also to download the csvs for our db.

Now that that's out of the way, time for to do list and progress!

TODO:
- Clean up the DB file for better access to information. This includes getting rid of all
  pre-Gen V data in the pokemon_moves table, as well as all non-English data in all tables which
  support multiple languages.
- Work into the MoveFactory and PokemonSpeciesFactory classes, create arrays of both these objects for quick access in-game.
- Our goal right now is to establish a working battle system that can handle any Pokemon with any moves, held items, etc.

PROGRESS:
- Database is successfully implemented. Species Array can be created, entering the dex number into the array returns base stats, 
  more info such as dex entries and stuff still required as of writing this.
- Battle math is near-complete. (Requires some item implementation still)
- PokemonFactory class complete. Inserting a species into the class along with EV/IV values will provide a pokemon with correct stats.
